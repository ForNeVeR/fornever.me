    title: .NET Support Dates
    description: This post describes the current .NET support policy and dates which are sometimes hard to figure out from the official documentation.
---

Once in a while, I want to know which versions of .NET are currently officially supported. Unfortunately, itr may be hard to figure this out from the official Microsoft documentation. So I've decided to collect this information in this post. I intend to update this information when new .NET versions come out in the future, and with more precise dates if they're available.

This post will help you to determine whether a particular .NET version has any kind of official support from Microsoft (and thus if you should consider support in your software).

## .NET Framework

### Notes

I wasn't able to find any sources for actual .NET Framework 3.5 support dates. [Lifecycle FAQ][docs.lifecycle-faq] sends the reader to the [Lifecycle Policy][lifecycle.net-framework] document, which hasn't .NET Framework 3.5 listed as a separate entry. The [clarification on the support life cycle][support.lifecycle-clarification] lists it as unsupported, though it has no dates:

> The original version of the .NET Framework 3.5 together with the .NET Framework 2.0 SP1 and the .NET Framework 3.0 SP1 are no longer in support.

According to the [Lifecycle FAQ][docs.lifecycle-faq], .NET Framework 4.5.2 is considered as a part of several operating systems, and thus has the same mainstream/extended support dates as the OS. From these operating systems, [Windows 8.1][lifecycle.windows-8.1], Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2 have the longest extended support periods (all the same dates), so the support dates for this framework correspond to the dates of Windows 8.1 extended support.

Note that there's [Windows 7][lifecycle.windows-7] Extended Security Updates, which currently span up to Year 3 and ends at the same date as Windows 8.1, but if it will be extended more, then it may determine the extended support date for .NET Framework 4.5.2.

According to the [Lifecycle FAQ][docs.lifecycle-faq] .NET Framework 4.6 (the same for 4.6.1)

> \[…] is supported as a Windows component on the latest required operating system update for \[…] Windows 10.

It is unclear how to interpret that, but considering other .NET Framework versions have clarified versions listed (say, Windows 10 Anniversary Update (Version 1607) for .NET Framework 4.6.2), I consider that as limited to Windows 10 (Version 1507) support date. I don't know whether my interpretation is correct, but consider it as the most sane.

Here, I consider [Windows 10 Enterprise and Education][lifecycle.windows-10.enterprise-edu] support dates for Windows 10, since they're generally later or the same as for the corresponding versions of [Windows 10 Home and Pro][lifecycle.windows-10.home-pro].

.NET Framework versions from 4.6 to 4.7.2 are considered as parts of the corresponding operating systems (according to the [Lifecycle FAQ][docs.lifecycle-faq]), and have the same support dates. I'll list the operating systems I've chosen to take the dates from in the table below.

| .NET Framework Version | OS Version                |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| .NET Framework 4.6     | Windows 10 (Version 1507) |
| .NET Framework 4.6.1   | Windows 10 (Version 1507) |
| .NET Framework 4.6.2   | Windows Server 2016       |
| .NET Framework 4.7     | Windows Server 2016       |
