    title: Multiple languages are supported on this site
    description: A small note about latest developments of this site.
---

[For a long time][issue-10] I wanted to add English language support to the
site, and to start writing posts in English. Finally, I've found the time to
implement this.

This post will be the first in my blog that will be published in both English
and Russian. I'll eventually translate all the other posts, too. Comments for
the older posts were preserved, but the URL scheme has been changed a bit. At
the beginning, I also wanted to preserve the redirects from the older post
locations to the newer ones, but ultimately I've decided that it will require
too much effort.

I'd like to point my regular readers (if they ever exist) to the changes in RSS:
the site now has _three_ RSS feeds.

* [`/rss.xml`](/rss.xml) — the main feed than contains posts in both English and
  Russian
* [`/en/rss.xml`](/en/rss.xml) — English only posts
* [`/ru/rss.xml`](/ru/rss.xml) — Russian only posts

Please, set up your RSS readers according to your language preferences. For a
while, English part of the site will be pretty empty, bit I hope to bring the
parity one day by translating all of my materials to both languages.

If you found a bug or a flaw in a multilanguage version of the site — please,
feel free to notify me either through comments or through the site [issue
tracker][tracker]. I will be glad to fix any problems you encounter.
