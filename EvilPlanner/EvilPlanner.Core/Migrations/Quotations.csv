1;After I captures the hero's super-weapon, I will not immediately disband my legions and relax my guard because I believe whoever holds the weapon is unstoppable.  After all, the hero held the weapon and I took it from him.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
2;"All bumbling conjurers, clumsy squires, no-talent bards, and cowardly thieves in the land will be preemptively executed; all annoying and/or humorously clever robots and androids will be destroyed; and it shall be declared a capital crime to be the ""town drunk"".  The hero will certainly give up and abandon his quest if he has no handy source of comic relief.";The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
3;All deathtraps will have only one way in or out, with any way out leading to an even more cunning deathtrap that works faster.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
4;All guards (and other workers) will be entitled to three weeks paid vacation a year after one full year's employment, will be covered (after that same period) by comprehensive medical and dental insurance (paid by me, the Evil Overlord) for themselves and spouse/companion and all dependents.  They will have regularly scheduled pay-raises for every five years with which they remain in my employ as well as annual, merit-based bonuses.  Stock options and retirement plans will be made available after five years of employment along with favorably termed loans for home improvement, education and debt consolidation.  Any employee disabled in my service will receive a lifetime pension.  Every year, my organization will make a few sizable college scholarships available for the most qualified of the dependents of my employees.  Upon leaving my employ they will be constrained from working for any competitor or adversary for a period of not less than five years.  All dismissals (as opposed to termination on their part) will be accompanied by a payment of one month's salary as termination pay and an excellent recommendation (regardless of cause for dismissal).  Good will is more valuable than terror on the part of my employees.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
5;All midwives will be banned from the realm.  All babies will be delivered at state-approved hospitals.  Orphans will be placed in foster-homes, not abandoned in the woods to be raised by creatures of the wild.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html

8;All my secret escape pods will come with leather interior, dual climate zone comfort system, AM/FM stereo with 5 disk CD changer, emergency small arms cache, first aid kit, and a pair of fuzzy dice hanging from the rear view mirror.  There is never a bad time to show a bit of style.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
9;All naive, busty tavern wenches in my realm will be replaced with surly, world-weary waitresses who will provide no unexpected reinforcement and/or romantic subplot for the hero or his sidekick.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
10;All non-instantaneous deathtraps (drowning pools, trash compactors, gas chambers, etc.) in my fortress will be isolated from the communications and power grids.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html

12;All slain enemies will be cremated as soon as possible.  They will not be left for dead in a hidden area.  An announcement of their demise, plus the attendant public celebration, will be deferred until after the urn full of ashes has been placed into my hands.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
13;All younger siblings, spouses, children, students, and old army buddies of an enemy I have just killed will be hunted down to prevent them from attacking me at some future point in a quest for vengeance.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
14;Any captured-and-released or escaped Hero will have numerous tracking devices of several levels of detectability installed in his effects, vehicles, and person, at least one of which will have been ingested with his last food or drink.  Even so, I will never fail to put up a serious effort to track or intercept him by other means as well.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
15;Any data file of crucial importance will be padded to 1.45MB in size.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
16;"Any documentation that I must keep regarding my latest plan for global domination/ultimate weapon/etc. will be kept in a folder labeled something uninteresting, such as ""Sewage System Maintenance Logs"".  I will, however, leave on my desk a folder with a catchy, upbeat label like ""Operation: Annihilate"".  In the folder will be a single diskette, labeled only with a skull-and-crossbones.  On the diskette will be the nastiest viruses, Trojan horse programs, and computer worms that I and/or my henchmen can devise.  My base's computers will of course be protected against anything on this diskette, and inserting the diskette into a computer on my base will trigger the death rays.";The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
17;Any new concubines I plan to add to my harem will go through a complete screening process, including tests for STDs.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
18;Any ultimate weapon that was disassembled in the distant past and the components of which were scattered to the far parts of the world could not have been that great in the first place, or no one would have disassembled it.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
19;Anyone making any kind of deliveries to my fortress will be required to show proper identification and submit their conveyance to an inspection before they can pass through the gate.  Same applies when they leave.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
20;As an alternative to not having children, I will have lots of children.  My sons will be too busy jockeying for position to ever be a real threat, and the daughters will all sabotage each other's attempts to win the hero.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
21;Before putting my Master Plan into action, I will hire a board-certified team of architects and surveyors to examine my headquarters closely and inform me of any secret passages and abandoned tunnels that I might not know about.  This team will then be paid ludicrous amounts of money and relocated to the Caribbean Island of their choice, where they will live out their lives in luxury.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
22;Before spending available funds on giant gargoyles, gothic arches, or other cosmetically intimidating pieces of architecture, I will see if there are any valid military expenditures that could use the extra budget.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
23;Despite the delicious irony, I will not force two heroes to fight each other in the arena.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
24;During times of peace, my Legions of Terror will not be permitted to lie around drinking mead and eating roast boar.  Instead they will be required to obey my dietician and my aerobics instructor.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
25;Efforts spent breaking a heroine's spirit allow time for things such as heroic rescues or are uncertain enough to allow last minute betrayals.  Rather, I'll have my staff take several high-quality photographs of her, hire a good plastic surgeon and the ugliest girl in my kingdom, make one to look just like her, but not until after I've pumped two rounds of .45 hardball into the heroine's head, then fed her to my pet crocodiles.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
26;I must assume that deathtrap manufacturers' brochures base their Estimated Time to Kill (ETK) on tests using non-heroes (and moreover generally test only the minimum ETK).  Therefore, Heroes trapped in one of my non-instantaneous deathtraps will remain there a minimum of several times longer than the trap's ETK, and even then will be treated as potentially dangerous until any remains are incinerated.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
27;"I reserve the right to execute any henchmen who appear to be a little too intelligent, powerful, or devious.  However if I do so, I will not at some subsequent point shout ""Why am I surrounded by these incompetent fools?!""";The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
28;I will add indelible dye to the moat.  It won't stop anyone from swimming across, but even dim-witted guards should be able to figure out when someone has entered in this fashion.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
29;I will allow guards to operate under a flexible work schedule.  That way if one is feeling sleepy, he can call for a replacement, punch out, take a nap, and come back refreshed and alert to finish out his shift.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
30;I will always dress in bright, cheery colors...  Mostly soft pastels.  Wearing nothing but black is too depressing, while wearing all white is too boring.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
31;I will always keep a few Useless but Loyal Advisors on the payroll and in proximity to both help my enemies underestimate me and provide a few extra bodies between the enemy and myself should my defenses be penetrated.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
32;I will be neither chivalrous nor sporting.  If I have an unstoppable super-weapon, I will use it as often as possible instead of holding it in reserve.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
33;I will be secure in my superiority.  Therefore, I will feel no need to prove it by leaving clues to my Master Plan in the form of riddles for my enemies to find.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
34;I will be selective in the hiring of assassins.  Anyone who attempts to strike down the hero the first instant his back is turned will not even be considered for the job.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
35;"I will build machines which simply fail when overloaded, rather than wipe out all nearby henchmen in an explosion or worse yet set off a chain reaction.  I will do this by using devices known as ""surge protectors"".";The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
36;I will carefully read and reread Machiavelli's The Prince, Sun Tzu's The Art of War, and Dr. Phillip C. McGraw's Self Matters before I set out on my quest to conquer the universe.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
37;I will classify my lieutenants in three categories: untrusted, trusted, and completely trusted.  Promotion to the last category is only done posthumously.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
38;I will decree that all hay be shipped in tightly-packed bales.  Any wagonload of loose hay attempting to pass through a checkpoint will be set on fire.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
39;I will design fortress hallways with no alcoves or protruding structural supports that intruders could use for cover in a firefight.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
40;I will encourage general promiscuty, restrict access to birth control, and provide the best in STD research/prevention and pre- and post-natal care.  The resultant population will be more satisfied and complacent, and will fuel my war machines, production, dressmaking, and general fun.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
41;I will endeavor to treat the ancient, sylvan forests surrounding my keep in a kindly, eco-friendly manner.  By no means will I rip up every tree within five miles of my castle in order to provide raw materials for my orc breeding program.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
42;I will exchange the labels on my folder of top-secret plans and my folder of family recipes.  Imagine the hero's surprise when he decodes the stolen plans and finds instructions for Grandma's Potato Salad.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
43;I will explain to my guards that most people have their eyes in the front of their heads and thus while searching for someone it makes little sense to draw a weapon and slowly back down the hallway.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
44;I will exploit my subjects, but not to the point of destitution, decrepitude, or desperation.  I am evil, not stupid.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
45;"I will force the fair maiden to marry me in a quiet civil ceremony rather than a lavish spectacle put together with three weeks warning...  And the final phase of my Master Plan will not be carried out during my wedding.  If she says ""Ill die before I marry you!"" I'll shoot her.  There are, after all, hordes of beautiful young women out there just waiting to marry someone as rich and powerful as I am.";The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html

47;I will have no nubile female assistants.  All my assistants will be former members of the East German swim team.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
48;I will instruct my guards when checking a cell that appears empty to look for the chamber pot.  If the chamber pot is still there, then the prisoner has escaped and they may enter and search for clues.  If the chamber pot is not there, then either the prisoner is perched above the lintel waiting to strike them with it or else he decided to take it as a souvenir (in which case he is obviously deeply disturbed and poses no threat).  Either way, there's no point in entering.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
49;I will learn from the likes of Enron for how to steal ungodly amounts of money, instead of resorting to ransoming the planet with my latest doomsday device (which I never get to use, anyway).;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
50;I will maintain plausible deniability at all times.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
51;I will make every effort to either suborn my foes or kill them.  Humiliating them and enraging them through acts of depravity motivated solely to upset them will only rebound negatively against my long term interests.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html

53;"I will make sure that there is a clear understanding of who is responsible for what in my organization.  For example, if my general screws up, I will not draw my weapon, point it at him, say ""And here is the price of failure!"", then suddenly turn and kill a random underling.";The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html

65;"I will not fly into a rage and kill a messenger who brings me bad news just to demonstrate how evil I am.  Loyal service should be rewarded...

And besides, honest messengers are hard to come by when you are in the Evil Overlord business.";The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
66;I will not gloat over my enemies' predicament to show my superiority.  I will shoot them.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
67;I will not grow a goatee.  Yes, it is true that in the old days they made you look sinister.  Unfortunately, these days they only make you look like a disaffected member of Generation X.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
68;I will not have a daughter.  Although she would certainly be as evil as she is beautiful, once she sees the hero's rugged good looks, she will no doubt betray me to him.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
69;I will not have a son.  Although his eventual and surely laughable plan to overthrow me will fail, it could provide a fatal distraction at a crucial moment.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
70;"I will not hire one of the hero's old flames to infiltrate the rebellion.

73;I will not indulge in the practice of maniacal laughter, despite the proven stress-relieving effects of such behavior.  When so occupied, it is too easy to miss unexpected developments that a more alert and attentive individual would notice.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html
74;I will not interrogate my enemies in my inner sanctum.  A small hotel room located well outside the borders of my kingdom works just as well and has the benefits of privacy and intimacy.  After the interrogation, I will shoot them.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html

84;"I will not use any Master Plan for which the final step is horribly complicated (for example, ""align the 12 stones of power on the sacred altar and activate the medallion during a total eclipse"").

85;I will not use area-effect, mind-altering spells as a long term solution to civil unrest.  a) They wear off, or eventually the subjects gain or breed immunity, and the population I made to love me will grow to hate me.  b) Outsiders not falling to the initial spell will quickly become suspicious at my subjects' mindless happiness and obeisance, and try to do something about it.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html

87;I will not resort to android duplicates to safeguard myself from capture by my enemies because: (a) What I can construct others can emulate. If my minions are familiar with the use of androids they may make the mistake of letting the wrong one past their guard.;The Evil Overlord List;http://legendspbem.angelfire.com/eviloverlordlist.html

96;I will spare someone who saved my life sometime in the past.  This is only reasonable as it encourages others to do so.  However, the offer is good one time only.

102;If an attractive young couple enters my realm, I will carefully monitor their activities.  If I find they are happy and affectionate, I will ignore them.

114;If I discover that the hero is the offspring of my Trusted Lieutenant, I will never allow the Trusted Lieutenant to try to turn the Hero to my service.  The hero will just turn my Lieutenant against me, and a good second-in-command is hard to come by.  Rather,  I'll just accept the cost of training a new second-in-command and kill the Trusted Lieutenant.  He's just trying to turn the hero to his side so he can overthrow me anyway.  But if I temporarily lose my mind and allow my Trusted Lieutenant to try and turn the hero to my service, I will order the Trusted Lieutenant out of the room while I confront the hero.

118;If I have children and then grandchildren, I will keep my three-year-old granddaughter near me at all times.  When the hero enters to kill me, I will first ask him to explain why it is that her beloved Grandpa has to die.  When the hero launches into a long-winded, way-over-her-head dissertation on morality, that will be her cue to pull the lever that sends the hero into the pit of crocodiles.

The fair maiden will always be gagged, bound hand and foot, and either secured to some very stable object well away from all other objects in the room, or even better, hogtied.

However, if I do kill the fair maiden, I have the problem of disposing of the body and I no longer have the leverage provided by the threat of killing her.  If the fair maiden presents a problem in terms of being a witness, I will solve that problem by blindfolding her or making her wear a hood.
