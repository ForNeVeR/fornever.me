============================================

This is the [fornever.me][] site source code. It uses ForneverMind â€” a simple
homemade blog engine mainly written in F# programming language.

Build
-----

### Frontend

To compile frontend part, you'll need a recent (6.9.1+) [Node.js][node-js]
installation. The bundled [Yarn][yarn] package manager will be automatically
executed on build.

### Talks

There's an additional talks archive included as git submodule in this
repository. To prepare tasks for build, use the `Scripts/Prepare-Talks.ps1`
script.

### Backend

To compile the backend, you'll need a [.NET Core][dotnet-core] installation.

Here's a sample build script:

```console
$ dotnet restore
$ dotnet build
$ cd ForneverMind
$ dotnet run
```
