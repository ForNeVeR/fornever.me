fornever.me: Engineer, Programmer, Gentleman [![Status Ventis](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-ventis-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/ForNeVeR/andivionian-status-classifier) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/dh7qx27hrjs8chp3/branch/develop?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ForNeVeR/fornever-me/branch/develop)
============================================

This is the [fornever.me][] site source code. It uses ForneverMind â€” a simple
homemade blog engine mainly written in F# programming language.

Build
-----

### Frontend

To compile frontend part, you'll need a recent (6.9.1+) [Node.js][node-js]
installation. The bundled [Yarn][yarn] package manager will be automatically
executed on build.

### Talks

There's an additional talks archive included as git submodule in this
repository. To prepare tasks for build, use the `Scripts/Prepare-Talks.ps1`
script.

### Backend

To compile the backend, you'll need [NuGet][nuget] and [MSBuild][msbuild] or a
compatible build engine.

Here's a simple build script:

```console
$ nuget restore
$ msbuild /p:Platform="Any CPU" /p:Configuration=Release ForneverMind.sln
```

There're MSBuild properties `/p:DeployBackend=true /p:PublishProfile=Production`
that will deploy the site to the directory configured in
`ForneverMind/__profiles/Production.pubxml`.
