fornever.me: Engineer, Programmer, Gentleman [![Status Enfer](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-enfer-orange.svg)](https://github.com/ForNeVeR/andivionian-status-classifier) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/dh7qx27hrjs8chp3/branch/develop?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ForNeVeR/fornever-me/branch/develop)
============================================

This is the [fornever.me][] site source code. It uses ForneverMind â€” a simple
homemade blog engine mainly written in F# programming language.

Build
-----

To compile the site, you'll need [NuGet][nuget] and [MSBuild][msbuild] or a
compatible build engine.

Here's a simple build script:

    $ nuget restore
    $ msbuild /p:Platform="Any CPU" /p:Configuration=Release ForneverMind.sln

There's a PowerShell build script `Scripts/Deploy.ps1` that will build and
deploy the site to the directory configured in
`ForneverMind/__profiles/Production.pubxml`.

Other components
----------------

1.  [EvilPlanner][evil-planner] meant to be an integral part of the site, but it
    need to be installed separately.
2.  [fornever.me][] uses an easy-to-install [Disqus][disqus] comment system.
