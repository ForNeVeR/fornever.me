fornever.me: Engineer, Programmer, Gentleman [![Status Ventis](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-ventis-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/ForNeVeR/andivionian-status-classifier) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/dh7qx27hrjs8chp3/branch/develop?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ForNeVeR/fornever-me/branch/develop)
============================================

This is the [fornever.me][] site source code. It uses ForneverMind â€” a simple
homemade blog engine mainly written in F# programming language.

Dependencies
------------

ForneverMind requires recent [Node.js][node-js] installation both for building
and for running.

Configuration
-------------

Backend reads its settings from the standard `appsettings.json` file. The
available settings are:

- `baseUrl`: URL to listen when started

Build
-----

### Frontend

To compile frontend part, you'll need a recent (6.9.1+) [Node.js][node-js]
installation. The bundled [Yarn][yarn] package manager will be automatically
executed on build.

### Talks

There's an additional talks archive included as a git submodule in this
repository. To prepare tasks for build, use the `Scripts/Prepare-Talks.ps1`
script.

### Backend

To compile the backend, you'll need a [.NET Core 2.0][dotnet-core] installation.

Here's a sample build script:

```console
$ dotnet build
$ cd ForneverMind
$ dotnet run
```

Test
----

```console
$ cd ForneverMind.Tests && dotnet xunit
```

Publish
-------

To prepare the artifact for publishing, run the following:

```console
$ dotnet publish --configuration Release --output out
```

The site is published as a Docker instance, see [Dockerfile][dockerfile].
There's a [convenience script][compose.ps1] to publish the site via
docker-compose. Sample publishing script:

```console
$ dotnet build --configuration Release ForneverMind.Frontend # see issue #57 about that
$ dotnet publish --configuration Release --output out
$ scripts/docker/compose.ps1
```

Other components
----------------

1. [EvilPlanner][evil-planner] meant to be an integral part of the site, but it
   need to be installed separately.
2. [fornever.me][] uses an easy-to-install [Disqus][disqus] comment system.
