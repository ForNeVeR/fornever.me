fornever.me: Engineer, Programmer, Gentleman [![Status Ventis](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-ventis-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/ForNeVeR/andivionian-status-classifier) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/dh7qx27hrjs8chp3/branch/develop?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ForNeVeR/fornever-me/branch/develop)
============================================

This is the [fornever.me][] site source code. It uses ForneverMind â€” a simple
homemade blog engine mainly written in F# programming language.

Build
-----

To compile frontend part, you'll need a recent (6.9.1+) [Node.js][node-js]
installation. Then execute the following script inside of
`ForneverMind.Frontend` directory:

    $ npm install
    $ npm run webpack # or `npm run optimize` for optimized build

_(You may alternatively use Webpack-compatible task runner for your IDE.)_

To compile the backend, you'll need [NuGet][nuget] and [MSBuild][msbuild] or a
compatible build engine.

Here's a simple build script:

    $ nuget restore
    $ msbuild /p:Platform="Any CPU" /p:Configuration=Release ForneverMind.sln

There's a PowerShell build script `Scripts/Deploy.ps1` that will build and
deploy the site to the directory configured in
`ForneverMind/__profiles/Production.pubxml`.
